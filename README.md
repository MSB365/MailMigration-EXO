Four Scripts that can help for Exchange Migration Tasks.
For each Script are CSV. Files as preparation needed. The CSV Files should look like the following example:

*"Name","Alias","NewName","NewAlias"* -> For the Scripts: **CreateMultipleSharedMailboxes.ps1 CreateMultipleEquipmentMailboxes.ps1 CreateMultipleRoomMailboxes.ps1**


*"Mailbox","UPN","Permission","AssignedTo","MailboxType"* -> For the Script: **SetMailboxPermissions.ps1**
